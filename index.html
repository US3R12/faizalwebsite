            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I’m Faizal! I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional passionate about threat hunting, incident response, and digital forensics. My goal is to specialize in detecting, analyzing, and mitigating cyber threats to help organizations stay secure.</p>
            <p>I’m currently working on my Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification and completing a cybersecurity program with Simplilearn to build a solid foundation in network security, penetration testing, and malware analysis. I spend a lot of time doing hands-on labs, CTF challenges, and real-world security exercises to sharpen my skills.</p>
            <p>Beyond structured learning, I’ve been actively gaining experience through freelancing on Fiverr, where I offer cybersecurity services and help clients improve their digital security. I also explore Blue Team labs to strengthen my knowledge in security monitoring, log analysis, and incident response.</p>
            <p>My journey into cybersecurity started out of pure curiosity—I’ve always been fascinated by how systems work and how attackers exploit them. Over time, this curiosity turned into a deep interest in defensive security, and now I’m working towards making it my career. I’m looking for entry-level cybersecurity roles in Bangalore (remote or onsite) where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and grow in the field.</p>
            <p>When I’m not diving into security, I enjoy learning about new attack techniques, improving my problem-solving skills, and staying up to date with cybersecurity trends. I believe cybersecurity is a field where learning never stops, and I’m always eager to explore new challenges.</p>
            <p>Let’s connect and talk about all things security!</p>
